Inconsistency: some Statements take other Statements, others just rely on values on top of the stack
  - could be used to ensure right number of arguments on stack
Immutable data (e.g. quoted data)
Improper list lambdas
Definitions (function)
 - Internal definitions
Proper line numbers
Make middle neater by using macro matching
More efficient macro matching (regular expression simple and fast)
Split trampolines, as they are doing two things at the moment, trampoline and CallValue
Sort out nil vs null discrepancy
Check name mangling works
