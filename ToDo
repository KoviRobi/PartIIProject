Inconsistency: some Statements take other Statements, others just rely on values on top of the stack
  - could be used to ensure right number of arguments on stack
Immutable data (e.g. quoted data)
Improper list lambdas (perhaps TODO1 could help)
Make java calls not syntactic
Definitions
 - Internal definitions
Java "new", possibly smalltalk like message passing on ObjectValues
Library import (need an ImportBinding probably)
Proper line numbers
Make middle neater by using macro matching

R7RS P. 25
In a program or library declaration, it is an error to import the same identifier more than once with different bindings, or to redefine or mutate an imported binding with a definition or with set!, or to refer to an identifier before it is imported. However, a REPL should permit these actions.

- Have Libraries a special class that can get loaded by a class loader?
