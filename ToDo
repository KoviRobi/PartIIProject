Immutable data (e.g. quoted data) - nice but not necessary
Improper list lambdas

Proper line numbers
Make middle neater by using macro matching
More efficient macro matching (regular expression simple and fast) --- Measure performance to see if we need this
Sort out nil vs null discrepancy

eval tail call---can we test this?
Java call order, e.g. CLOS is left to right for specialisation
make CallStack not static, for multithreading
