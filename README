At the moment, only the front-end of the compiler is done.

To understand the parser, have a look at
rmk35/partIIProject/frontend/SchemeFile.g4, it includes the other parts of the
grammar, and uses parser actions to construct abstract syntax trees. The
abstract syntax tree objects are under rmk35/partIIProject/frontend/AST/

Alll AST items contain working versions of:
  eq
  eqv
  equal
  mutable
  toString
